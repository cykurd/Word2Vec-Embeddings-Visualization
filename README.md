# Word2Vec-Embeddings-Visualization
Towards Dynamic and Interactive 3D Word Embedding Visualizations

The code for our project is provided in the .qmd file.  
  
* To use the code, with your own dataset, replace the areas in the code that specific "x$feedback".  
* The data will be easily compatible with the code in a single vector, where each entry is some collection of words.  
* Run your data through the same data cleaning that x$feedback was run through.   
* Ensure the model and "word_list" are running on the data you provide.
  
From there, feel free to run the code to see how the visualization works.
